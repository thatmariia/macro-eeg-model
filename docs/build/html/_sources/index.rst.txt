Macro EEG model documentation
=============================

This is the documentation for codebase of the macroscopic EEG modeling with axon propagation delays.
It is associated with the preprint mentioned in `Associated preprint`.

It includes the instructions on how to generate and open this very documentation (see `Documentation`) and
how to prepare the environment for the codebase (see `Preparation`).

After completing the preparation, you can learn
how to execute the code (see `Usage`) and
how to reproduce the results (see `Reproducing results`).

If needed, the documentation explains
how to access the original connectivity data (see `Data Access`).

Finally, it includes the API documentation for the codebase (see `API Reference`).
If you use this code in your work, you can find how to cite it in `Citation`.
